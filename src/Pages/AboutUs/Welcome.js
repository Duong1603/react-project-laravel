                <p>
                  Like everyone else under the sky, I bear lots of issues, both
                  physical and psychological.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I’d been on this quest to search for the answers, for why I
                  was the way I was for years on end.
                </p>
                <p>Then in December 2020, RTT found me. Lucky!</p>
                <p>
                  Ever since I went under for the first time, I’ve never looked
                  back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Things buried deep bubbled up to the surface. I ran. I hid. I
                  fought. Then I won.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sense of connection, with my true self, with everyone
                  else, and for most, with the world is ever present in me.
                </p>
                <p>I’m grounded, deeply rooted. </p>
                <p>Calm. Peace. Relax. </p>
                <p>
                  Every step I walk. Every breath I take. I experience a full
                  ray of emotions. In touch. In tune. No matter how you put it.
                  It’s blissful.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>I’m just a normal person. A mom. A teacher. A healer.</p>
                <p>
                  I’m the melting pot of emotions, characters, and personas.
                </p>
                <p>I’m the master of my own palette of colors.</p>
                <p>Does it sound like a chameleon? Isn’t it full of life? </p>
                <p>So, Who am I? </p>
                <p>
                  PS: This blissful soul is looking for like-minded spirits to
                  accompany each other’s healing journeys. Are you one? Send me
